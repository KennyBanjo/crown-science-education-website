Physics is a subject where small misunderstandings can lead to consistently wrong answers. Unlike some subjects, where partial knowledge still earns marks, physics often requires precise understanding — a single conceptual error can cascade through a calculation or explanation.

The good news is that the most common mistakes are predictable and fixable. Here are five errors that appear repeatedly in GCSE Physics exams, along with clear explanations of how to avoid them.

## 1. Confusing mass and weight

This is perhaps the most common conceptual error in GCSE Physics. Many students use "mass" and "weight" interchangeably, but they are fundamentally different quantities.

**Mass** is the amount of matter in an object. It is measured in kilograms (kg) and does not change regardless of location. Your mass is the same on Earth, on the Moon, and in space.

**Weight** is the force of gravity acting on that mass. It is measured in newtons (N) and changes depending on the gravitational field strength. On the Moon, where gravity is weaker, you would weigh less — but your mass would be identical.

The relationship between them is:

**Weight (N) = Mass (kg) x Gravitational field strength (N/kg)**

On Earth, gravitational field strength is approximately 9.8 N/kg (often rounded to 10 N/kg in GCSE questions).

**How to avoid this mistake:** Always check your units. If the answer should be in newtons, you are calculating weight. If in kilograms, you are dealing with mass. And never write that an object "weighs 5 kg" — it has a mass of 5 kg and weighs approximately 50 N.

## 2. Forgetting to convert units

Physics calculations require consistent units. The most common unit conversion errors involve:

- **Kilometres to metres** — multiply by 1,000
- **Grams to kilograms** — divide by 1,000
- **Minutes or hours to seconds** — multiply by 60 or 3,600
- **Kilowatt-hours to joules** — multiply by 3,600,000
- **Centimetres to metres** — divide by 100

A student who calculates speed using kilometres for distance and seconds for time will get an answer that is 1,000 times too large. The maths may be perfect, but the answer is wrong because the units were inconsistent.

**How to avoid this mistake:** Before substituting values into a formula, check that all quantities are in standard SI units: metres, kilograms, seconds, amperes, newtons, joules, watts. Convert first, then calculate.

## 3. Misunderstanding velocity and acceleration

Students often confuse these three related but distinct concepts:

**Speed** is how fast something is moving. It is a scalar quantity — it has magnitude but no direction.

**Velocity** is speed in a given direction. It is a vector quantity. An object moving at 5 m/s north has a different velocity from one moving at 5 m/s south, even though their speeds are the same.

**Acceleration** is the rate of change of velocity. It is not the same as speed. An object can be moving at high speed with zero acceleration (constant velocity). An object can be accelerating while momentarily stationary (a ball thrown upward at its highest point).

A particularly common error is thinking that an object with zero velocity must have zero acceleration. Consider a ball thrown straight up: at the very top of its trajectory, its velocity is momentarily zero, but it is still accelerating downward due to gravity.

**How to avoid this mistake:** Remember the definitions precisely. Acceleration is about change in velocity, not velocity itself. Practice describing motion scenarios in precise physical terms.

## 4. Incorrectly reading or drawing graphs

Physics exams frequently include distance-time and velocity-time graphs. Students often make these errors:

**On distance-time graphs:**
- Thinking a steeper line means higher acceleration (it means higher speed — the object is covering more distance per unit time, but at a constant rate)
- Forgetting that a horizontal line means the object is stationary, not moving at constant speed
- Confusing the gradient (which gives speed) with the area under the graph (which has no useful physical meaning for distance-time graphs)

**On velocity-time graphs:**
- Confusing the gradient (which gives acceleration) with the y-axis value (which gives velocity)
- Forgetting that the area under the line gives the distance travelled
- Not recognising that a line below the x-axis represents motion in the opposite direction

**How to avoid this mistake:** Learn what each feature of each graph type represents:

| Feature | Distance-time graph | Velocity-time graph |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Gradient | Speed | Acceleration |
| Flat line | Stationary | Constant velocity |
| Curved line | Changing speed | Changing acceleration |
| Area under line | (Not used) | Distance travelled |

Practise sketching graphs from descriptions of motion, and describing motion from given graphs. Both skills are commonly tested.

## 5. Not showing working in calculations

This is not a conceptual mistake, but it costs students marks in almost every physics exam. Many students jump straight to the final answer without showing their method.

Physics mark schemes typically award marks for:

1. **Writing the correct formula**
2. **Substituting values correctly**
3. **Performing the calculation**
4. **Giving the answer with correct units**

If you skip steps 1 and 2 and go straight to step 3, you can only earn a maximum of two marks even if your answer is correct. And if your answer is wrong — perhaps due to a calculator error — you earn zero marks, because the examiner cannot see where you went right.

**How to avoid this mistake:** Always follow this pattern:

```
1. Write the formula:         v = u + at
2. Substitute the values:     v = 0 + (2 × 5)
3. Calculate:                 v = 10
4. Write the answer with units: v = 10 m/s
```

This takes an extra 30 seconds but can be worth multiple marks.

## Bonus: other common errors to watch for

- **Confusing current and voltage** — current is the flow of charge; voltage is the energy transferred per unit charge
- **Thinking that thicker wires have more resistance** — thicker wires have less resistance, because there is more space for electrons to flow
- **Forgetting that light travels in straight lines** — refraction and reflection change the direction, but between these events, light always travels in straight lines
- **Using the wrong equation** — always check that your formula matches the quantities you have been given. If you know force and distance, use W = Fd for work done. If you know power and time, use E = Pt for energy.

## Final thoughts

These five mistakes are not signs of poor understanding. They are common pitfalls that catch even capable students. The difference between a student who makes these errors and one who does not is usually awareness and practice — not ability.

Review your past papers and mock exams. Look for patterns in the marks you lose. If you consistently make one of these errors, spend focused time on that concept until the correct understanding becomes automatic.

Physics rewards precision. Take the time to be precise, and the marks will follow.
