The periodic table is one of the most important tools in chemistry. It organises all known elements in a way that reveals patterns in their properties, and understanding how to read it is essential for GCSE Chemistry.

Many students find the periodic table intimidating at first. But once you understand the logic behind its structure, it becomes a powerful aid rather than a source of confusion.

## How the periodic table is organised

The periodic table arranges elements in order of increasing **atomic number** — the number of protons in an atom's nucleus. This arrangement is not arbitrary: it groups elements with similar chemical properties together.

The table is organised into:

- **Periods** — horizontal rows, numbered 1 to 7
- **Groups** — vertical columns, numbered 1 to 8 (or 0 for the noble gases)

The period tells you how many electron shells an atom has. The group tells you how many electrons are in the outermost shell. This is why elements in the same group behave similarly — they have the same number of outer electrons, and it is these outer electrons that determine how an element reacts.

## Groups you need to know

### Group 1 — Alkali metals

Lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), and others. These metals are:

- Very reactive, increasingly so down the group
- Soft enough to cut with a knife
- Stored in oil to prevent reaction with water or air
- They react with water to produce a metal hydroxide and hydrogen gas

**Key reaction:** 2Na + 2H2O → 2NaOH + H2

As you go down Group 1, the atoms get larger, and the outer electron is further from the nucleus and more easily lost. This is why reactivity increases down the group.

### Group 7 — Halogens

Fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I). These non-metals are:

- Reactive, but reactivity decreases down the group
- Exist as diatomic molecules (e.g., Cl2, Br2)
- Form ions with a -1 charge (called halide ions)

**Key concept:** A more reactive halogen can displace a less reactive halogen from its compound. For example, chlorine displaces bromine from potassium bromide:

Cl2 + 2KBr → 2KCl + Br2

Reactivity decreases down Group 7 because the atoms get larger, and it becomes harder to attract an additional electron into the outer shell.

### Group 0 — Noble gases

Helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), and others. These gases are:

- Extremely unreactive (inert)
- Colourless and odourless
- Used in applications where reactivity is undesirable (e.g., argon in light bulbs)

Noble gases have full outer electron shells, which makes them very stable. They do not need to gain, lose, or share electrons, so they rarely form compounds.

## Electron configuration

Understanding electron configuration is key to understanding the periodic table. Electrons occupy shells around the nucleus, and each shell can hold a limited number of electrons:

- **First shell:** up to 2 electrons
- **Second shell:** up to 8 electrons
- **Third shell:** up to 8 electrons (at GCSE level)

For example:
- **Sodium (Na)** has 11 electrons: 2, 8, 1 — it is in Period 3, Group 1
- **Chlorine (Cl)** has 17 electrons: 2, 8, 7 — it is in Period 3, Group 7
- **Neon (Ne)** has 10 electrons: 2, 8 — it is in Period 2, Group 0

The electron configuration directly corresponds to the element's position in the periodic table. If you know the configuration, you know the group and period — and vice versa.

## Trends across the periodic table

The periodic table reveals several important trends:

### Across a period (left to right)

- **Atomic radius decreases** — more protons pull the electrons closer to the nucleus
- **Elements transition from metals to non-metals** — Group 1 and 2 are metals; Groups 6 and 7 are non-metals
- **Reactivity** — metals become less reactive (harder to lose electrons); non-metals become more reactive (easier to gain electrons)

### Down a group

- **Atomic radius increases** — each period adds a new electron shell
- **For metals (e.g., Group 1):** reactivity increases (outer electron is further from nucleus, easier to lose)
- **For non-metals (e.g., Group 7):** reactivity decreases (outer shell is further from nucleus, harder to attract electrons)

## Metals, non-metals, and metalloids

The periodic table has a rough dividing line between metals and non-metals:

- **Metals** are found on the left and centre of the table. They are typically shiny, conduct electricity and heat, are malleable and ductile, and form positive ions.
- **Non-metals** are found on the right side. They are typically poor conductors, brittle (if solid), and form negative ions or share electrons in covalent bonds.
- **Metalloids** (like silicon) sit on the boundary and have properties of both.

## Transition metals

The block of elements in the middle of the periodic table (between Groups 2 and 3) are the transition metals. At GCSE, you need to know that they:

- Have high melting points and densities
- Can form ions with different charges (e.g., Fe2+ and Fe3+)
- Often form coloured compounds
- Are useful as catalysts (e.g., iron in the Haber process)

## How to use the periodic table in exams

In your GCSE exam, you will be given a copy of the periodic table. Use it to:

1. **Find atomic numbers and mass numbers** for calculations
2. **Identify the group and period** of an element to predict its properties
3. **Work out electron configurations** from the element's position
4. **Predict reactivity** based on group trends
5. **Determine the type of bonding** an element is likely to form (ionic for metal + non-metal, covalent for non-metal + non-metal)

Do not try to memorise the entire table. Instead, understand its structure and how to read it.

## Practice questions to test yourself

1. What is the electron configuration of magnesium (Mg, atomic number 12)?
2. Why is potassium more reactive than sodium?
3. Predict whether bromine can displace iodine from potassium iodide solution. Explain your answer.
4. Why are noble gases unreactive?
5. An element has the electron configuration 2, 8, 6. What group and period is it in? Is it a metal or a non-metal?

Work through these questions, check your answers against your notes, and identify any areas where you need further review.

## Final thoughts

The periodic table is not just a reference chart — it is a map of how elements behave and why. Once you understand its patterns, many aspects of chemistry become more predictable and logical.

Spend time learning the key groups, practising electron configurations, and understanding the trends. This foundational knowledge will support you throughout your GCSE Chemistry course and beyond.
